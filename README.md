# Car-Parking-System
This project implements a Verilog-based Smart Car Parking System that automates the entry and exit process in a parking area using sensors and password authentication.
The system tracks the number of vehicles inside the parking lot, indicates availability using LEDs, and ensures secure entry through a password verification mechanism.

## Features
- Automatic entry detection using sensors
- Password-based vehicle authentication
- Dynamic vehicle counting (entry and exit)
- Real-time indication using Green and Red LEDs
- Display of parked and available spaces
- Simulation verified in Xilinx Vivado
